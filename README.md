## applications created by the community will be published here.
### how do I publish apps?
* you need to send a pull-request to this repository
* the pull-request must contain the application files in the "apps" folder, and information about it in the "list.lua" file

### what requirements should publishing applications meet?
* do not contain malicious code
* do not resist deletion
* have no analogues among the available applications
* not to be a "dummy" or just useless software (I determine the degree of usefulness)
* have names and an icon reflecting the essence of the application
* applications should have the same icon and name in the "market" and after installation
* applications should not load additional files/modules/code from third-party resources
* applications should be installed normally without errors
* do not have spaces in the name
* the name must consist exclusively of English letters, the first letter must be lowercase, upper case is allowed to separate words, the character "_" is also allowed, but "_" cannot stand at the beginning or end of the name, cannot go several times in a row, and also cannot be used in the name for more than two once
* applications cannot have functionality that is available in another application or in the system itself
* the name must not exceed 16 characters in length
* the application should not spoil the appearance of the "market" application or desktop
* your application cannot make changes to the "system" folder
* your application can use the /data folder and registry to store its files/data, but it is obliged to remove all traces of its presence after deletion
* your application cannot interfere with the operation of other applications/system
* your application must comply with the "unlicense" license
* your application should not have someone else's code if it is not published under the "unlinense" license
* when installing the application, no unnecessary actions can be performed except for the installation
